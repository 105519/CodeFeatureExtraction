# Code Feature Extraction

# Data Process

In folder *data*, there are two data processing code *ENRE.py* and *DataProcess.py* and few data in folder *py150_files* for playing a demo.

In folder *py150_files*, there is another README file that introduces the data set.

You can play the demo using the following command:
