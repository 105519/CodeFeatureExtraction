Code Dependency Extraction Tools

Depends
Link: https://github.com/multilang-depends/depends
Advantage: Supports 5 languages(cpp, java, ruby, python, pom); 3 levels of granularity(level of folder, file, method); 5 output formats(json, xml, excel, dot, plantuml)
Disadvantage: Have bug on file granularity: Wrongly judge that two files are related, when they both have a global variable with the same name

ENRE (Selected to use)
Link: https://github.com/jinwuxia/ENRE
Advantage: The output graph is very detailed: 4 types of nodes includes (level of folder, file, method and variable); 8 types of edges(import, call, use, return, parameter and so on)
Disadvantage: Only supports 2 languages(python, go); 3 output formats(json, xml, dot)

Rexdep
Link: https://github.com/itchyny/rexdep
Advantage: This is a special tool which extracts code dependency by finding regular expressions in code. Thus it deeply supports customization.
Disadvantage: It can only roughly extract dependency relation.(for example, 'import numpy' in comment)
